      <LegalSection>
        This Privacy Policy explains how Entrypoint Labs, Inc. (
        <LegalLead>&quot;we,&quot;</LegalLead> <LegalLead>&quot;us,&quot;</LegalLead> or{" "}
        <LegalLead>&quot;our&quot;</LegalLead>), the team building Xend, handles information in
        connection with Xend — the website at xend.global, the Xend mobile
        application, and related services (together, the{" "}
        <LegalLead>&quot;Service&quot;</LegalLead>).
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>1. Who We Are.</LegalLead> Entrypoint Labs, Inc. is the
        team building Xend, a dollar account for everyday life. Xend lets you
        hold a balance in U.S. dollars, fund it from a linked bank account or
        local payment method, and send or receive dollars to or from other
        Xend users by username.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>2. Information We Collect.</LegalLead> We collect the
        following categories of information in connection with the Service:
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>Account and device information.</LegalLead> When you
        create an account, we receive a public key and credential identifier
        from your device&apos;s passkey — the biometric data used to unlock
        it (such as a fingerprint or face scan) never leaves your device and
        is not something we ever see or store. We do not currently require
        identity verification such as a government ID to open an account,
        though we may request it in the future as described in our Terms of
        Service.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>Balance and transaction information.</LegalLead> We
        maintain a record of your Balance and of transfers you send or
        receive, including the counterparty username, amount, and time. When
        you fund your Balance from a bank account or local payment method,
        we and our banking or payment partners process the information
        necessary to complete that funding transaction, such as the linked
        account details you provide. Transfers between Xend users settle on
        the Solana blockchain, a public ledger; the resulting on-chain
        transaction data is publicly visible on that network independent of
        anything we do.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>Compliance and screening information.</LegalLead> We use
        blockchain analytics tools to screen the on-chain transactions
        associated with your account for exposure to sanctioned parties,
        suspected money laundering, or other financial crime risk
        indicators, as described in our Terms of Service. This screening
        produces information about your account and transactions, such as a
        risk flag or match against a watchlist.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>Usage and log information.</LegalLead> Our hosting
        provider and app infrastructure generate standard logs for requests
        made to the Service, which may include an IP address, device and app
        version information, and the time of the request. We use
        privacy-friendly analytics, described in Section 4, to understand
        aggregate usage of the website.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>Communications.</LegalLead> If you contact us by email or
        on X using the details in Section 10, we see whatever information
        you choose to include in that message.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>3. How We Use Information.</LegalLead> We use the
        information described in Section 2 to: operate your account and
        process transfers and funding requests; secure the Service and
        prevent fraud, unauthorized access, and abuse; comply with
        applicable law; communicate with you about your account, security,
        or changes to the Service; and diagnose technical problems and
        improve the Service. We do not sell information collected through
        the Service, and we do not use it to build advertising profiles.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>4. Cookies.</LegalLead> The website uses Vercel Analytics
        to measure aggregate traffic. Vercel Analytics is designed to avoid
        cross-site tracking and does not use cookies to identify individual
        visitors across sites. Beyond what this analytics service strictly
        requires to function, the website does not set tracking cookies or
        use similar tracking technologies.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>5. Third-Party Services.</LegalLead> The Service is hosted
        on Vercel&apos;s infrastructure, which processes logs and analytics
        data on our behalf. We use Resend to send transactional email, and
        we work with banking or payment partners to let you fund your
        Balance from a linked bank account or local payment method — those
        partners process the information necessary to complete a funding
        transaction under their own privacy practices, which we encourage
        you to review when you connect a funding source. We also use
        blockchain analytics providers to screen on-chain transactions for
        compliance purposes, as described in Section 2. Transfers between
        Xend users settle on the Solana network, a public blockchain that we
        do not operate or control. Each of these third parties has its own
        privacy practices that this Policy does not cover.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>6. Data Sharing.</LegalLead> We do not sell your personal
        information. We may share information described in Section 2 with:
        service providers who help us operate the Service, such as hosting,
        email, and banking or payment partners, under obligations to
        protect it; our blockchain analytics and transaction screening
        providers, so they can screen your account and transactions as
        described in Section 2; law enforcement or regulators where
        required by law, where a screening provider flags a transaction, or
        to investigate fraud, security incidents, or violations of our
        Terms of Service; and another party in connection with a merger,
        acquisition, or sale of assets, subject to that party&apos;s
        continued obligations under this Policy.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>7. Data Retention.</LegalLead> We retain account and
        transaction information for as long as your account is active, and
        for a reasonable period afterward as needed for security, fraud
        prevention, dispute resolution, or legal and financial recordkeeping
        obligations. We retain server logs only as long as needed for
        security and operational purposes, after which they are deleted or
        aggregated in a way that no longer identifies a specific person.
        Because transfers settle on the Solana blockchain, we cannot delete
        the on-chain record of a completed transaction — that record exists
        independently on a public, immutable ledger.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>8. Your Rights.</LegalLead> Depending on where you are
        located, you may have rights to request access to, correction of, or
        deletion of personal information we hold about you, or to close your
        account. To make a request, contact us using the details in Section
        10 and describe the information involved as specifically as you can;
        we will respond within a reasonable time and may ask you to verify
        your request before acting on it. Some information, such as records
        we must keep for legal or financial recordkeeping purposes and data
        that exists on the Solana blockchain, cannot be deleted even upon
        request.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>9. Children.</LegalLead> The Service is not directed to
        children and is not available to anyone under 18. We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children.
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>10. Contact.</LegalLead> Questions about this Policy, or
        requests related to your information, can be sent to us by email at{" "}

      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection>
        <LegalLead>11. Changes to This Policy.</LegalLead> We may update this
        Policy from time to time by posting a revised version with a new
        &quot;Last Updated&quot; date. For material changes, we will make
        reasonable efforts to notify you in the app or by email before they
        take effect. Continued use of the Service after a revision is posted
        constitutes your acceptance of it.
